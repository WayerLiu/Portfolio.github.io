                        <p>Kolkata, like many densely populated Indian cities, faces a stray dog problem due to the coexistence of humans, stray dogs, and wildlife. The city's hot and dry climate has led to issues such as dog bites and dehydration as the stray dog population continues to grow. While the city has tried to address this problem with measures prioritizing human safety, such as cages and restrictive areas, these approaches have been seen as hostile. A more friendly and hospitable approach is needed to naturally attract stray dogs and establish zoning without invasive measures. </div>

                        <p>Using a simple self-feeding machine, we provide the opportunity to the local community to care for their well-being without necessarily having to interact with them. By placing this in the streets of Kolkata, everyone in the city can see when the stations are empty and dogs are in need, and dogs can also access food when they need it.</p>

                        <p>We aim to create vaccination stations which are mobile and can move from place to place vaccinating and tagging dogs. Our approach is to use the chaiwala cart typology so which is typically used to serve chai on the streets. this typology has all the same necessities as a vaccination station such as portability and storage for medical supplies, while also being practical solution as the carts already exist.

                        <p>The stigma around dogs in India makes it even harder for strays to find shelter and refuge in humans. To de-stigmatise the reputation and make the community care about dogs, the idea was to create temple-like shelter. Religion is already about sharing, helping out, and caring for others. Hence, it would be rather natural to accentuate this aspect in a communal space so that dogs and humans can coexist peacefully.
